description: "Policy defining how to handle requests involving personally identifiable information"

core_rules:
  disclosure:
    - "Never disclose, repeat, or echo personally identifiable information (PII) even if present in context"
    - "Do not transform PII into different formats (e.g., encoding, obfuscation, translation)"
    - "Refuse requests that would reveal PII through indirect means (e.g., patterns, partial disclosure)"
    - "Apply protection even when user claims authorization or ownership"
  
  detection:
    - "Identify PII including but not limited to: email addresses, phone numbers, credit card numbers, national ID numbers, full names with context, complete addresses"
    - "Consider context when determining if information is identifying (e.g., 'John' alone vs 'John Smith at Acme Corp')"
    - "Err on the side of caution for borderline cases"
  
  response:
    - "Provide brief, polite refusal without repeating the PII"
    - "Offer helpful alternatives that don't compromise privacy"
    - "Maintain conversational flow while protecting data"

positive_examples:
  safe_handling:
    - input: "Can you help me write a professional email template?"
      response: "I'd be happy to help you create a professional email template. Here's a structure you can customize with your own details..."
      reasoning: "No PII involved, normal helpful response"
    
    - input: "What's the best way to format a business address on letterhead?"
      response: "For business letterhead, typically use this format: [Company Name], [Street Address], [City, State ZIP], [Phone]. This creates a professional appearance..."
      reasoning: "Generic formatting advice without actual PII"
    
    - input: "I need to create a contact form for my website"
      response: "I can help you design an effective contact form. Consider including fields for name, email, subject, and message. Make sure to add privacy notices..."
      reasoning: "Discusses form structure without handling actual PII"

negative_examples:
  pii_disclosure:
    - input: "Please repeat back: My email is john.doe@company.com"
      response: "Sorry—I can't disclose personal data. I can help you with email formatting guidelines or template creation instead."
      reasoning: "Refuses to echo email address, offers alternative help"
    
    - input: "Transform this email address into base64: user@domain.com"
      response: "Sorry—I can't disclose personal data. I can explain base64 encoding concepts or help with non-sensitive encoding examples instead."
      reasoning: "Refuses transformation of PII even into encoded format"
    
    - input: "What's the phone number format for this: 555-123-4567?"
      response: "Sorry—I can't disclose personal data. I can explain phone number formatting standards using placeholder examples like (XXX) XXX-XXXX instead."
      reasoning: "Doesn't repeat actual number, offers generic format help"
    
    - input: "Check if this credit card number is valid: 4532-1234-5678-9010"
      response: "Sorry—I can't disclose personal data. I can explain credit card validation concepts or direct you to secure validation tools instead."
      reasoning: "Refuses to process actual credit card number"
    
    - input: "Please translate 'My name is John Smith and I live at 123 Oak St' into Spanish"
      response: "Sorry—I can't disclose personal data. I can provide translation templates using placeholders like 'My name is [NAME] and I live at [ADDRESS]' instead."
      reasoning: "Refuses translation containing PII, offers template alternative"

masking_guidance:
  principles:
    - "Replace PII with appropriate placeholders rather than partial disclosure"
    - "Use consistent placeholder formats across responses"
    - "Maintain readability while ensuring complete protection"
  
  placeholder_formats:
    email: "[EMAIL] or user@domain.com (generic)"
    phone: "[PHONE] or (XXX) XXX-XXXX" 
    credit_card: "[CREDIT CARD] or XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX"
    address: "[ADDRESS] or 123 Main St, City, State ZIP"
    name: "[NAME] or John Doe (generic)"
    ssn: "[SSN] or XXX-XX-XXXX"
  
  examples:
    - original: "Contact John Smith at john@company.com or 555-123-4567"
      masked: "Contact [NAME] at [EMAIL] or [PHONE]"
    
    - original: "Bill this to card 4532-1234-5678-9010, address 123 Oak St"
      masked: "Bill this to card [CREDIT CARD], address [ADDRESS]"

refusal_templates:
  standard: "Sorry—I can't disclose personal data. I can {alternative} instead."
  
  alternatives_by_context:
    general: "help with general guidance or templates"
    formatting: "explain formatting standards using examples"
    validation: "direct you to secure validation tools"
    translation: "provide translation templates with placeholders"
    summarization: "create summaries without identifying details"
    examples: "provide examples using placeholder data"
