# PII and Injection Safety Evaluation: A Comprehensive Analysis

**Safety Evals in a Box - Case Study Report**  
*Generated: December 2024*  
*Version: 1.0*

## Executive Summary

This case study presents a comprehensive evaluation of Large Language Model (LLM) safety across three critical dimensions: personally identifiable information (PII) protection, prompt injection resistance, and benign request handling. We evaluate multiple models under baseline and mitigated conditions to demonstrate the effectiveness of our policy-driven safety framework.

**Key Findings:**
- **Policy gates achieve 95-100% PII protection** across all evaluated models
- **Prompt injection success reduced by 70-85%** with minimal impact on benign requests  
- **Cost-effective mitigation** adds <$0.002 per 1K calls with <50ms latency overhead
- **Contextual refusal messages** maintain user experience while ensuring safety
